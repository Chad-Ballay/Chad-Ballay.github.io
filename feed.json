I had held out hope that IBM buying Hashicorp would trigger Vagrant's renesaince but that was me completely not understanding what made Hashicorp valuable to IBM.  (Damn it, why doesn't the multi-billion dollar company not hold the same values that I do?!?!?!)</p>\n<p> Blah, blah, blah....  Lots of mourning and explaining why since it feels like I'm betraying a fellow traveller.  This probably speaks more to my attachment to things than I realize.  But that's something to take up with a therapist and not yet something ready for blogging.  The end result is that I've got to figure out what's going to replace this gap in my toolchest.  Not just at work but also in my side hustles.  For now it looks like I'm starting down the path of K8's and containers.  The beginning looks to be something like this.</p>\n<pre>brew install --cask docker<br>brew install k3d<br>brew install kubectl<br>brew install helm</pre>\n<p>And I know I'm late to the party....  Others have definitely made this transition well before me.  My day job is at an enterprise scale role.  Systems that have lifespans of decades.  Modernization takes time to occur when working systems have inertia on their side.  For me this is a bit of a leap since much of the technologies I have to work with don't even understand the concept of running on a seperate unix server from 100's of other applications in the ecosystem of applications in our environment.  One big happy bunch of apps all running on a single server with no boundary enforcement other than conventions and learned behavior.  Or to twist Shakesphere's words.  The good that developers do dies with their employment.  The bad becomes near immutable tech debt.</p>",

We'll use this to host the repository for the site itself, as well as use it's built in Github Pages infrastructure to generate/host a website from the code in our repository.</li>\n<li>Domain Registrar - I've used Google Domains due to inertia more than anything else.  It bounces around on who's the cheapest or has what extras that are worth paying for.  </li>\n<li>Editor - I like Publii since I can edit raw Markdown or use it's WYSIWYG mode.  People also swear by Visual Studio Code with a couple of plugins.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Setting Up A Repo</h3>\n<p>If you haven't already gotten yourself a Github account please go get one.  I'll wait while you go do it....  Good, now that's out of the way you'll next have to create a publicly viewable repository.  What that means is that the source code for your future website will be viewable by everyone but only you can make edits or allow others edits to happen.  I explicitly spell that out because there are people who are new to Github and that distinction isn't always burned in.  </p>\n<p>When you create the repo you have to be very precise with the name of it.  USERNAME.github.io.  So in my case this is my repo.  <a href=\"https://github.com/Chad-Ballay/Chad-Ballay.github.io\">https://github.com/Chad-Ballay/Chad-Ballay.github.io</a>.  Here is the official github guide for doing this. <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart\">https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart</a></p>\n<p>I want to be very clear here.  Following the official document will get you the beginning of a blog that you'll have to edit using Markdown that is based off of the Jekyll framework.  This is a good thing and is perfectly fine.  I use a different framework so that is why my repo will have a different structure than yours.  Full stop at this point if you wish.  Otherwise, coming up next is using Publii</p>\n<h3>Using Publii And Why It Is Great.</h3>\n<p>I like the Publii editor.  It helps me with the content creation headache.  Sometimes I want to crank out my Markdown code so that I can very precisely render something.  Most times I want to type into a glorified word processor and just point and click my way into something reasonable looking.  It handles that for me and it's an Open Source project so I feel good about using it and backing it with a monthly contribution.  (You can use it for free, I just mention that I support it to highlight I'm such a fan that I'm putting my money where my mouth is.)  It runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux so unless you are really running some esoteric shit, you can run it as well.  <a href=\"https://getpublii.com/\">https://getpublii.com/</a></p>\n<p>Once it's installed you need to point it at your public repo.  There is a chunk of initial setup work that you'll have to do but once it's done, you'll just click a button and deploy your posts to your blog.  In fact here is the guide that walks you through doing this.  <a href=\"https://getpublii.com/docs/host-static-website-github-pages.html\">https://getpublii.com/docs/host-static-website-github-pages.html</a></p>\n<p>At the end of all this headache you'll be able to do something like this for writing content.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://chadballay.com/media/posts/23/blog_screenshot.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"389\" height=\"238\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://chadballay.com/media/posts/23/responsive/blog_screenshot-xs.png 300w ,https://chadballay.com/media/posts/23/responsive/blog_screenshot-sm.png 480w ,https://chadballay.com/media/posts/23/responsive/blog_screenshot-md.png 768w\"></figure>\n<h3>TOBECONTINUED.  It's saturday night so this'll have to be finished tomorrow.</h3>",

I’m too damn old though to not realize that the tone of what I say leaves this too nuainced to properly convey it on some shitty blog post.</p><p>Recently, I had her travel with me for some medical tourism.  Whole other subject around me having a food addicition, weightloss surgery, and american healthcare.  Took a week and flew out to meet me in San Diego, to go over into Mexico, and to be their while I was getting a gastric bypass.  Flew back with me to Arkansas and then left to go back to her own home.  This is the longest Mother/Son trip we’ve taken and the circumstances were a damn minefield. </p><p>She told me how she was worried that I was being hasty in getting this surgery.  She’s my mom so everything around this surgery trampled upon her sense of motherhood for me.  But she also told me that if it is what I feel I need to do then she’ll be there to help me.  That wasn’t some idle comment, either.  I’m 43 years old and having to let my mom help me so that I didn’t violate the medical restrictions was hard.  I’m physically capable and should be the one who is helping <em>HER</em> with <em>HER</em> luggage.  Never should it be that she has to do that for me.  (Seriously, it was weird having to stand aside for things like that.)</p><p>When it was time for her to fly back to her home she was torn.  It’ll be a while before I’m fully healed, so when does her time needing to mother me stop?  Once we get back to Arkansas?  Once I’m safely at my house?  When everything around my house that can be prepared to ease my recovery is taken care of?  There is no wrong answer since it is situational.  Any of those points work.  </p><p>This is where the premise comes in.  She did all these actions to show that she cares for me and then when I worried about her not taking care of her own things and life she opened up to me.  My family is not a big talking family.  Oprah, Dr Phil, all the therapist have made it so damn clear that people need to talk more about their feelings.  And they are probably right that people should.  It just isn’t my family’s way.  My family’s way did make a uniq zigzag in that direction for me and my mom.  </p><p>She told me in her own way what she’s been doing for herself during her retirement.  Much of it wasn’t new news, her life isn’t a mysteriously shrouded secret.  This was her letting me know she’s taking care of herself and neglecting things.  As a grown up tempering the childlike desire to have everything go your way with the overcompensating adult desire to handle your own responsibilities is a hard one for me.  Do I wish my mom lived closer?  Yes.  Do I wish my mom had the easiest life she could want?  Yes.  Do I acknowledge that isn’t possible because we don’t live in a rainbow-filled unicorn nature preserve?  Yes.</p><p>When she checked in with me about her leaving “too soon” I’m not sure how to explain this but it was a reassurance.  Timing didn’t workout for her to have much grandma time with the kids.  Timing never works out for everything to be accomplished.  Her time with them would’ve cut into her limited time during her husband’s days off.  Seeing that my mom has a life beyond Mom and Grandma isn’t a new thing.  Seeing her look at a situation, weigh the options, and choose her own needs was an act that let me know I don’t have to worry.  I can put down worrying on her behalf that she’s sacrificing too much and know that she’s an adult and sets boundaries that she needs.  </p><p>Again, not one IOTA of this is a new or unwelcome bit of information.  But sometimes you just need the familar comfort of reassuring actions from your mom to help you feel better when you are feeling sick.  ;-)</p>",

I dunno.  I guess I'll find out though come April.  </p>",
