Usually a soft pause happens in a conversation where that is revealed but occasionally a direct question is asked. It is always a weird one because I have to guess what level of info do I reveal.</p><p>Some of it is that the songs are catchy and usually the lyrics are clear to hear. No multiple singers singing over each other usually. With my hearing that’s sometimes a quick path into chaos.</p><p>Some of it is because much of the lyrics are the inner voices of the character and it explains the motivation without breaking the fourth wall. Being on the spectrum, I have a hard time understanding motivations.</p><p>A lot of it is because I damn well like the art form and enjoy the fact that people get slightly miffed when they find out a 6’6” straight dude is into musicals and not football….. Usually this doesn’t rile me up but this week had me get questioned as to why I would choose to not go to the TCU/Michigan Fiesta Bowl game.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 6, 2023</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchadballay.com%2Fbig-feelings-with-big-songs%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a></div><div class="post__tag"><ul><li><strong>Tagged in:</strong></li><li><a href="https://chadballay.com/tags/personal/">Personal</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__bio"><img src="https://chadballay.com/media/website/profile_pic.PNG" loading="lazy" height="1024" width="1024" alt="Chad Ballay"><div><h3><a href="https://chadballay.com/authors/chad-ballay/" class="invert" rel="author">Chad Ballay</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul><li><a href="https://chadballay.com/impossible-list/" target="_self">Impossible List</a></li><li><a href="https://chadballay.com/tags/story-of-my-life/" target="_self">Story Of My Life</a></li></ul></nav><section><header class="major"><h2>Get in touch</h2></header><ul class="contact"><li class="icon solid fa-envelope"><a href="mailto:chad.ballay@gmail.com">chad.ballay@gmail.com</a> </li><li class="icon solid fa-phone">(479) 381-8702</li><li class="icon solid fa-home">3002 S 14th Street<br>Rogers, AR 72758</li></ul></section><footer id="footer"><p class="copyright"></p></footer></div></div></div><script src="https://chadballay.com/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="https://chadballay.com/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://chadballay.com/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://chadballay.com/assets/js/util.min.js?v=cbdaf7c20ac2883c77ae23acfbabd47e"></script><script src="https://chadballay.com/assets/js/main.min.js?v=08add7f6d435054ad38ec38d7cf8be40"></script><script>var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};</script></body></html>
