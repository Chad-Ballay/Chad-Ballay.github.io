One of those nights that recharge you. Powers your spirits enough to lift those around you as well. In the past couple of weeks, I’ve been trying out this whole bike commuting thing. Cars run on cash and make you fat, bikes run on fat and save you cash. Quick little 7 mile ride each way with one hell of a hill.<br><a href="https://youtu.be/RubBzkZzpUA">Queue power song</a></p><p>My truck was left at work this evening after Elizabeth coordinated both our sons trial violin lesson with an awesome new teacher. Literally as we finally were driving up to our house we realized it and decided no more fucks were left to give. Margo was crying, the boys were asleep, and rush hour traffic had frazzled raw nerves at the end of the day. Normally this is where we figure out the minimum viable product for the evening and declare victory. Toss a light match over a shoulder into the stream of gasoline as we walk away and into the camera.</p><p>In the end, I had no choice but to shitcan my desire to wrap the day up early and instead had to go ride my bike to go get my truck. Not 1/2 a mile out the door the sky breaks open. And at that moment it was glorious. It’s been ages since I had such a primal and innocent experience. Being present with no distractions beyond keeping my two wheels upright and rolling. Seeing my town as I weaved through the roads. The gas station clerk waving at me as I drove past. Stopping in at a bar to hear the band for a song and a beer.
