I had held out hope that IBM buying Hashicorp would trigger Vagrant's renesaince but that was me completely not understanding what made Hashicorp valuable to IBM.  (Damn it, why doesn't the multi-billion dollar company not hold the same values that I do?!?!?!)</p><p> Blah, blah, blah....  Lots of mourning and explaining why since it feels like I'm betraying a fellow traveller.  This probably speaks more to my attachment to things than I realize.  But that's something to take up with a therapist and not yet something ready for blogging.  The end result is that I've got to figure out what's going to replace this gap in my toolchest.  Not just at work but also in my side hustles.  For now it looks like I'm starting down the path of K8's and containers.  The beginning looks to be something like this.</p><pre>brew install --cask docker<br>brew install k3d<br>brew install kubectl<br>brew install helm</pre><p>And I know I'm late to the party....  Others have definitely made this transition well before me.  My day job is at an enterprise scale role.  Systems that have lifespans of decades.  Modernization takes time to occur when working systems have inertia on their side.  For me this is a bit of a leap since much of the technologies I have to work with don't even understand the concept of running on a seperate unix server from 100's of other applications in the ecosystem of applications in our environment.  One big happy bunch of apps all running on a single server with no boundary enforcement other than conventions and learned behavior.  Or to twist Shakesphere's words.  The good that developers do dies with their employment.  The bad becomes near immutable tech debt.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 7, 2025</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchadballay.com%2Fnew-linux-vm-setup%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a></div><div class="post__bio"><img src="https://chadballay.com/media/website/profile_pic.PNG" loading="lazy" height="1024" width="1024" alt="Chad Ballay"><div><h3><a href="https://chadballay.com/authors/chad-ballay/" class="invert" rel="author">Chad Ballay</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul><li><a href="https://chadballay.com/impossible-list/" target="_self">Impossible List</a></li><li><a href="https://chadballay.com/tags/story-of-my-life/" target="_self">Story Of My Life</a></li></ul></nav><section><header class="major"><h2>Get in touch</h2></header><ul class="contact"><li class="icon solid fa-envelope"><a href="mailto:chad.ballay@gmail.com">chad.ballay@gmail.com</a> </li><li class="icon solid fa-phone">(479) 381-8702</li><li class="icon solid fa-home">1905 SE Clark Street<br>Bentonville, AR 72712</li></ul></section><footer id="footer"><p class="copyright"></p></footer></div></div></div><script src="https://chadballay.com/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="https://chadballay.com/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://chadballay.com/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://chadballay.com/assets/js/util.min.js?v=cbdaf7c20ac2883c77ae23acfbabd47e"></script><script src="https://chadballay.com/assets/js/main.min.js?v=08add7f6d435054ad38ec38d7cf8be40"></script><script>var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};</script></body></html>
